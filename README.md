## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS

### What I learned

I got a better understanding of css flexbox. Otherwise this project was just revision of what I learnt so far.


### Continued development

I will definetly need to focus of positioning with CSS, since I am still not good at it, and it takes me a long time to do
it decently.


### Useful resources
